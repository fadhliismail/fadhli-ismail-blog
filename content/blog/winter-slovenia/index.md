description: "Winter trip to Kranjska Gora"

January last year, my wife and I took a trip to Slovenia to experience the snow. I have been living in London for a while but I never really experience a proper snow. For 3 years I was in London, there was never a heavy snow fall, the kind of snow you see in Christmas films -- so thick it cover the street whole. The one time there was a heavy snow fall, I was in Malaysia. Unlucky.

It was not actually a planned holiday. My wife had a winter school which she was organizing, at Kranjska Gora, a ski resort in Slovenia. Since she will be there for a while, we thought it would be fun if I accompany her for the trip and get some skiing experience as well.

Together with all her colleagues from Imperial College, we arrived in Ljubljana at night and went to AirBnb booked prior. That night, we went to check on the city of Ljubljana. It was cold with temperature in the negative (3 to 8 degree C). While Sharah's collegues chugged down a few glasses of beer to keep them warm, we wrapped ourselves in thick blanket provided by the pub, shivering, while simmering our hot tea. The next day, again we went to the city of Ljubljana to soak in the atmosphere. When I am travelling, I love to walk a lot to get a feeling of the place I am visiting.

We continued our journey to Kranjska Gora. The journey should only take 1 hour but we stopped by at Lake Bled. Here, you can find the famous church located on a small inland, sitting right in the middle of Lake Bled. We went to a small part of Lake Bled where the surface of the water was frozen. Not thick enough to step on, so you can still see water movement under the frozen surface. Amazing.

After having our lunch, we continued our journey. At Kranjska Gora, Sharah got us a room overseeing the ski slope. At night, I watched people skiing down the slope with much interest. I had never experienced snow before, let alone skiing.

The next morning, while Sharah went to the summer school, I took a stroll around the village of Kranjska Gora. One of the reasons was to search for halal food. I was not officially part of the summer school delegation so I was not entitled to the food at the hotel. I found one not far from the hotel which served kebab. Good enough. In freezing weather it felt like a Michellin star restaurant. We would frequent this kebab shop throughout our time there. I also look for a place that offers sledging across the village. Much to our dissappointment, cross village sledging was not available since they deemed the snow not thick enough for the activity. Well, moving on.

To be continued........
