It's been some time that I have a medium to write and tell any stories.

This blog is intended for me to write about anything that I learn, mostly computer science algorithms, because I find it hard to remember those without writing about it or teaching it to others. It will serve as my personal notes and also a quick check.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
